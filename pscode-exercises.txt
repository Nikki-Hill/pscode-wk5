// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

# Function to check if a number is even or odd
def is_even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

# Main code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example value
    num = 10

    # Check if the number is even or odd
    result = is_even_or_odd(num)
    print(f"The number {num} is {result}.")



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


def read_numbers():
    numbers = []
    for i in range(5):
        num = float(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
        numbers.append(num)
    return numbers

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def find_min_max(numbers):
    smallest = min(numbers)
    largest = max(numbers)
    return smallest, largest

def main():
    # Step a: Read in 5 separate numbers.
    numbers = read_numbers()

    # Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers.
    average = calculate_average(numbers)

    # Step c: Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
    smallest, largest = find_min_max(numbers)

    # Step d: Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.
    print(f"The average of the five numbers is: {average}")
    print(f"The smallest number is: {smallest}")
    print(f"The largest number is: {largest}")
